### About the site

The name “Captive Thoughts” comes from Paul’s charge to “destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ” (2 Cor. 10:5). With this command in mind, Captive Thoughts strives to uphold the word of Christ in opposition to the arguments and lofty opinions of our day. 

My goal is to help Christians understand the secular worldview that permeates our culture and increasingly our churches. By addressing contemporary ideologies from a Christian worldview and testing them against Scripture, my hope is that this blog will equip believers to discern truth from error.

### About the author

Hi! My name is Aaron. I’m a Christian, and I enjoy writing about the faith that I have in my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. I’m also a 4th-year student at UCLA studying computer science. After graduating, I plan to work as a software engineer. 

I started this blog to push myself to learn about the worldview held on college campuses like my own. I am by no means an expert on these topics. For that, I would direct you to the work of [Voddie Baucham](https://www.voddiebaucham.org/), [Neil Shenvi](https://shenviapologetics.com/), [James Lindsay](https://newdiscourses.com/author/jameslindsay/), and [Heather Pluckrose](https://newdiscourses.com/author/helen-pluckrose/). But, I hope that the perspective I bring can be of some use to my peers and the church as a whole.
