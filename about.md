### About the site

The name “Captive Thoughts” comes from Paul’s charge to “destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ” (2 Cor. 10:5). With this command in mind, *Captive Thoughts* seeks to uphold the historic Christian faith that previous generations have passed down to us.
